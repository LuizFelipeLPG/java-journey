        // A system requires a "sensor reading" to be within a safe range (0-100).
        // The loop simulates retrying until a valid value is "received".
        




        // 2. Nested Logic within Loops:
        // Iterate from 1 to 10 and classify each number as Even or Odd.





        // 3. Multi-Condition Loop (Boolean Flag):
        // A process runs as long as the battery is above 10% AND the task is not finished.
        



        // 4. Resource Depletion Scenario:
        // A tank loses 15 units of water per cycle until it reaches a critical level (below 20).
