Welcome to my Java learning repository! This project is a comprehensive log of my progress, covering everything from basic syntax to Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🎯 Goal
The purpose of this repository is to document my theoretical understanding and practical application of the Java language. Each module consists of a well-documented `.java` file explaining the concepts, followed by hands-on exercises.

## 📁 Roadmap & Progress

- [x] **01. Primitive Data Types** - Understanding `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.
- [x] **02. Operators & Casting** - Arithmetic, logical operators, and type conversion.
- [x] **03. String Handling** - String pool, immutability, and comparison methods (`equals` vs `==`).
- [x] **04. Conditional Structures** - Flow control with `if`, `else`, and `switch`.
- [x] **05. Loops & Repetition** - Iterating with `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- [x] **06. Methods & Functions** - Logic abstraction, parameters, and return types.
- [ ] **07. Visibility Modifiers** - Access levels (private, default, protected, public).
- [ ] **08. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - *Coming Soon*

## 🚀 How to use this repo
Each folder contains:
1. A **Theory File**: A `.java` file with extensive comments explaining how the concept works.
2. An **Exercises Folder**: Practical challenges implemented by me to fix the content.
